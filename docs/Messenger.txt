Messaging between components
---------------------------------------
Requirements:
Must be able to pause the game, to change configs on different levels, that are 
supposed to change 
Extract some data, that are not available through logging 
On Dota2AiOverlay level - must be able to receive messages and change controls 
accordingly 
Msger communicates mostly with bot implementation and with Dota2AIFramework
In a way serves as "dynamic logging"

Can be useful:
Triggered messages (Like a warning in a incorrect state or state-to-be)
Message priority and criticalness -  as in logging
A way to send any kind of object
Some kind of addressing 
Message log


Using Messager 

Authority oriented
Needs one centralized interface that REDIRECTS messages/calls methods

----Dota2AIOverlay----
------Messager--------
----------------------

Dota2Bot -> Messager -> Sends message to MsgListener

----Dota2AIOverlay----
------MsgListener-----
----------------------

Resolves msg and redirects them to their location

+ One authority, that can log msges and that can control the flow
- The Messager must have a refrence to every component, as to redirect msges 


Distributed
Each component has its msging interface, msges go from down up and from up down 
Each component communicates with component that is preceeding or following it (structure tree)

Eg Hand can use msges to brain, but not to leg or eye. But brain can send any information to any part.
